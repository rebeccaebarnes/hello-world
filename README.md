I come from a background of social sciences, with a Bachelor of Psychological Science from the University of Queensland, Australia. I've 
always felt an affinity for math, statistics and research and have continued to find ways to build those elements into an environment that 
can be incredibly shy dealing with all three. I have almost 15 years working in homelessness and with at-in Brisbane, QLD, Australia
and Vancouver, BC, Canada. I started in front-line work but discovered that I appreciated the opportunity to work at a more macro-level,
attempting to identify and address systems and structures that hinder individuals from moving forward, using evidence-based practice.

Throughout my positions I have found opportunities to push the case for the usefulness of data and analysis, developing tools to measure
staff performance, non-profit performance standards and project budget management. I am published in Canham, S. L., Battersby, L., Fang, 
M. L., Wada, M., Barnes, R., & Sixsmith, A. (2018). Senior services that support Housing First in Metro Vancouver. Journal of 
Gerontological Social Work, 61(1), 104-125. doi:10.1080/01634372.2017.1391919

I am currently completing the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree with the goal of pursuing opportunities that allow data to influence social 
change.
